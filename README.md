To use the image classification program, follow these steps:

1.	Run the Python script.
2.	The program will display a splash screen with a loading animation.
3.	Once the loading is complete, the main window will open.
4.	Click on the "Upload Image Here" button to select an image for classification.
5.	The program will classify the image and display the predicted class label.

**Image Classification and Retrieval using Optimized PCNN**
============================================================

**Description**
---------------

This repository contains an image classification and retrieval model developed using the paper "Image classification and retrieval using optimized Pulse-Coupled Neural Network, The model uses a Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) to extract visual features from images and a K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm for classification and matching

**Model Architecture**
---------------------

The model consists of the following components:

* **Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN)**: extracts visual features from images
* **K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm**: classifies and matches images based on their features

**Requirements**
--------------
•	Python 3.x
•	tkinter
•	PIL (Python Imaging Library)
•	keras
