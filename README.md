**Image Classification and Retrieval using Optimized PCNN**
============================================================

**Description**
---------------

This repository contains an image classification and retrieval model developed using the paper "Image classification and retrieval using optimized Pulse-Coupled Neural Network" by Mona Mahrous Mohammed et al. (2015). The model uses a Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) to extract visual features from images and a K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm for classification and matching.

**Model Architecture**
---------------------

The model consists of the following components:

* **Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN)**: extracts visual features from images
* **K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm**: classifies and matches images based on their features

**Requirements**
--------------
•	Python 3.x
•	tkinter
•	PIL (Python Imaging Library)
•	keras
